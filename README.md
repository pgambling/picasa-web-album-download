# picasa-web-album-download
Downloads all the images from a Google Picasa public web album... because Picasa doesn't provide that convenience anymore...

## To Run

`node scrape.js <public url of picasa album>`

The url provided must link to the main grid view of all the thumbnails. The script is scraping this page to generate the neccessary image URLs to download.
